# HeartDiseasePrediction-Pyhton
The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict the probability of heart disease occurrence, based on a combination of features that describes the disease. In order to achieve the goal, we used Heart-Disease-Uci data from Kaggle.

	Explored data with visualization methods from Seaborn library and Matplotlib library.

	Used the corr() method and seaborn to create a heatmap based off that .corr() dataframe.

	Imported the Scikitlearn library with the Logistic Regression & Random Forest models.

	Predicted from the X_test and created a classification report and confusion matrix.
